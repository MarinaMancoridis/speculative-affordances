        <h2>What is iBuying?</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>
        <b>iBuying</b>, or instant Buying, is the process by which a company uses algorithms
        to instantly evaluate your home and make a cash offer,
        eliminating many of the traditional steps of listing
        and negotiating.
        </p>

            Instead of weeks or months, your home can sell in days—or even hours. This rapid turnaround holds <b>real appeal for sellers</b>, especially those who need certainty, speed, or who simply prefer not to deal with the hassle and uncertainty of traditional real estate transactions.
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p>
            iBuying also tends to <b>drive up prices</b> more broadly, since these algorithmic buyers often compete aggressively, bidding above typical market rates and creating upward pressure on home values.

                Major players—<b>Opendoor, Offerpad, Redfin, and Zillow</b>—have bought
                thousands of homes in this way, promising speed and convenience
                in exchange for a fee. Although Zillow left the iBuying business in 2021.
