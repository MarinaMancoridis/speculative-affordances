<h1 style="text-align: center;">Data Collection— The Presence of iBuying in Boston</h1>
<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left;">
    <p><b>How do you find a hidden market?</b> There is no public dataset of iBuying in the Greater Boston Area. While our previous chart focused more broadly on <i>corporate speculation</i> in Boston, our analysis wishes to look at iBuying in particular. 
        
    </p><p>Our analysis involved <b>creating our own dataset</b> of iBuying in the Greater Boston Area. To do this, we turned to the <a href="https://www.masslandrecords.com/">Mass Land Records</a>, searching for key names like Opendoor, Zillow, Redfin, and Offerpad—the big players in iBuying. This type of keyword matching is the approach that was used in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3630106.3659027">prior research</a>. 
    </p> 
    <p>Using this simple but powerful method, we uncovered <b>407 homes purchased by iBuyers</b> between 2019 and 2025. Of course, this likely understates the true figure: not every transaction may cleanly announce itself in the records. In other words, the story of iBuying in Boston may be even bigger than these numbers suggest. </p>
